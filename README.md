## About

The Brazil Federal [Constitution](http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/constituicao/constituicao.htm) of 1988 in its Art. 5th, item XIV, institutes "access to information is guaranteed to all and confidentiality of the source is guaranteed, when necessary for professional practice". 

However, recent episodes of national policy exposed the fragility of the youth Brazilian democracy in several aspects, including the confidentiality of the source, such as the attempt to coerce the delivery of sources in the case of the press editorial Vaza Jato. 
 
So, a group of Brazilian Journalists hired the famous Scottish investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist, co-founder and chief-editor at Millennium magazine, to develop a solution that helps to create safe communication in digital environments between journalists and their informants. 


## User Experience

### User Interface

The User Interface's aesthetic was inspired by the true protagonist of the Millennium trilogy, the hacker Wasp, also known as Lisbeth Salander. Therefore, the color palette was based on Salander's style and the background image in her profession.
